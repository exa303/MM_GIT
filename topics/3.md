Do you mean **William James** (1842–1910)? Because I couldn’t find anything reliable on “William James Toerija.” If yes, here’s a summary of who William James was:

---

## Who Was William James

* William James was an **American philosopher** and **psychologist**. ([Encyclopedia Britannica][1])

* He married **Alice Howe Gibbens** in 1878, and they had five children. ([Biography][3])
