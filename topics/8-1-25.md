* `Even a brick wants to be something` is a famous quote by American architect Louis Kahn, meaning that materials, like people, have inherent potential and should be used in a way that fulfills their nature, often aspiring to become something greater, like an arch, rather than being forced into a lesser role. 

The phrase gained wider pop culture recognition from Woody Harrelson's character in the 1993 film Indecent Proposal, where he uses it to illustrate architectural philosophy.
