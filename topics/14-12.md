```
I have a observation the more primitive group or civilization the more it dependant of each other(individuals i mean) , primitive in economic sence. is that correct observation?

```

Short answer: **yes, that’s largely a correct observation**, especially in an **economic and survival sense** — but it needs a bit of refinement.

### Why your observation holds

In economically “primitive” societies (hunter-gatherers, early agrarian villages):

* **Low specialization**
  Few surplus resources → people can’t afford to be independent specialists. Tasks like hunting, food prep, shelter, and defense are shared.

* **High survival risk**
  One injured hunter or failed harvest can be fatal alone. Mutual reliance reduces individual risk.

* **Limited markets and tools**
  No large-scale trade networks or institutions to replace social cooperation. Social bonds *are* the safety net.

* **Reciprocity over contracts**
  Cooperation is enforced socially (reputation, kinship, obligation), not legally or economically.

So individuals are **structurally dependent** on each other.

### What changes as economies develop

As societies become more economically complex:

* **Specialization increases** (division of labor)
* **Institutions replace people**
  Money, markets, insurance, welfare, law, and technology reduce direct dependence on neighbors or kin.
* **Anonymity becomes possible**
  You can survive without knowing who grows your food or makes your tools.

This creates **functional independence**, even though interdependence still exists at a systemic level.

### Important distinction (this is key)

* **Primitive societies:**
  High *direct* interpersonal dependence
* **Modern societies:**
  High *indirect* dependence on systems

You’re not actually less dependent today — you’re just dependent on **abstractions** instead of people.

### Where your theory would be wrong

If someone claimed:

> “Primitive societies are more cooperative because people are morally better”

That would be false. The cooperation is **economically enforced**, not necessarily altruistic.

### Refined version of your theory (more accurate)

> *The less economically developed a society is, the more survival depends on direct interpersonal cooperation; as economic complexity increases, dependence shifts from individuals to institutions and systems.*

That version would hold up well in anthropology and economics.

If you want, I can also tie this to:

* evolutionary biology
* game theory
* Marx / Durkheim
* modern tech societies and “loneliness paradox”

# Risk Pooling

Yeah — your memory is basically right, and you’re also right that **there *is* a term for this**, even if the Irish example is sometimes described informally.

### The general term you’re looking for

The **core concept** is called:

## **Risk pooling**

(or **mutual risk sharing**)

That’s the umbrella term used in economics and anthropology.

### More specific / traditional terms you might be mixing it with

Depending on context, you’ll see a few related names:

#### **Mutual aid**

* Voluntary, community-based support
* Common in pre-industrial rural societies
* Very likely how it would be described in Irish villages historically

#### **Reciprocity (generalized reciprocity)**

* No immediate payback expected
* “I help you now because I know the group will help me later”
* Extremely common in subsistence economies

#### **Commons-based insurance**

* Not a formal insurance contract
* Livestock, tools, or food losses are absorbed by the group

### The Irish angle (why your example makes sense)

In rural Ireland (and elsewhere in Europe):

* A cow was **capital**, not just food
* Losing one could ruin a household
* Markets and insurance barely existed
* So villages used **informal insurance mechanisms**

  * Everyone contributes a little
  * One household avoids collapse

Anthropologists would describe that as:

> **informal mutual insurance through community risk pooling**

### Modern equivalent

What you’re describing is functionally the ancestor of:

* insurance
* social security
* cooperative societies

Same logic, just formalized and abstracted.

### If you want the *single word* you’re trying to remember

The best bets are:

* **Mutual aid**
* **Risk pooling**
* **Reciprocity**
